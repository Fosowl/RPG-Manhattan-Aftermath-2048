Thank you for downloading this tileset! 

This tileset is a FREE release for anybody to download. This is a mini-expansion
for the Time Fantasy RPG assets. It's compatible with all other graphics that I release 
in my Time Fantasy style. Can also be used as a standalone tileset.

This set includes versions formatted for use in RPGMaker VX/Ace and RPGMaker MV, 
as well as a regular tile-sheet based on a 16x16 grid. 

Thanks to my wonderful patrons for making this free release possible!
