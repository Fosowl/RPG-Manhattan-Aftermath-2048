## Intro

We are in 2048, 10 years after the terrible chemical attack on Manhattan. Let me give you a short summary of this tragedy.
The United States had been in conflict with Russia for several years. As calm gradually returned, Russia
ordered a chemical attack against their enemies and more precisely in the famous district of New York "Manhattan". Caught short,
thousands of Americans were turned into zombies, it was then that the President decided to evacuate this area to stop this
virus.
To date, the district is only ruined, invaded by zombies but yet there are still two fugitives who have survived for more than 10
years old, Percy and Sora. They learned to protect themselves from these monsters, they know their behavior perfectly: the zombies burned as soon as they are
exposed to the sun and they are hungry as soon as they smell the blood.


The day began to rise, an ordinary day for our two rebels. As Percy and Sora wander around town looking for
Sora food is attacked by a troop of zombies.

Percy pulled out his gun directly but for fear of touching the teammate he didn't
not shoot. He ran after the zombies until the latter entered a dark building. Impossible to go further, Percy decided
to come back to Sora's rescue when the day is bright.

You must imperatively find your partner, time is short!
